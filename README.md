# Surv

A generative AI experiment.

This game was "vibe-coded" into existence. The entirety of the code, including the logic, assets, and this very README, was generated by a large language model based on a series of text prompts.

**There was no manual coding involved in this project.**

The goal was to explore the capabilities of generative AI in game development and to see how far we could push the boundaries of prompt-based coding.

## How to Play

Welcome to Surv! This is a first-person survival game set in a vast, procedurally generated world. The goal is to explore, gather resources, and build your own structures to survive.

### Controls

First, click on the game screen to lock your mouse and enable controls.

-   **Movement:**
    -   **W, A, S, D:** Move forward, left, backward, and right.
    -   **Mouse:** Look around.
    -   **Space:** Jump.
    -   **Left Shift:** Sprint to move faster.

-   **Interaction:**
    -   **E:** Press to collect resources like wood from trees, stones from the ground, or berries from bushes.
    -   **C:** Press to open and close the crafting menu.

### Gameplay Loop

1.  **Explore:** Roam the world to find different resources.
2.  **Gather:** Approach a resource and press **E** to collect it.
    -   **Trees** provide **Logs**.
    -   **Bushes** provide **Berries**.
    -   **Loose stones** on the ground provide **Stones**.
    -   **Fallen branches** provide **Branches**.
3.  **Craft:** Press **C** to open the crafting menu. If you have enough resources, you can craft items.
    -   **Stone Axe:** Requires 1 Branch and 2 Stones.
    -   **Firepit:** Requires 5 Logs and 2 Stones.
4.  **Build:** Once you craft a building piece (like a wall or floor), it will be ready to place in the world. Find a suitable spot and build your base.
    -   **Wooden Wall:** Requires 2 Logs.
    -   **Wooden Floor:** Requires 2 Logs.
    -   **Wooden Roof:** Requires 2 Logs.
    -   **Triangle Wall:** Requires 1 Log.

## The "Vibe"
The development process was driven by a "vibe" or a general feeling of what the game should be, rather than a detailed specification. Prompts were used to describe the desired mechanics, aesthetics, and overall feel of the game.
